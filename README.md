# WToken

Super simple token for Ether substitution.

* When someone transfers ether to the contract, tokens are minted. 1 token for 1 wei transferred.

* When you want your Ether back, you just burn your tokens and receive corresponding amount of Ether: 1 wei for 1 token burned.

* No fees or commissions â€” noone is making profit on this contract.

* Token contract is not pausable, and have no external control whatsoever.

* There should be no way for getting Ether from the contract except burning tokens.
